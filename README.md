# WSB_LED
This is a project from my Advanced Digital Design class that I am turning into a personal project because I enjoyed playing around with these LED strips


This project is requiring a lot of timing calculations and head scratching.
I'm hoping that my comments in the modules themselves are solid enough to make out what's going on. 
This is a series of finite state machines dedicated to driving a strip of four GRB leds in various modes.
The strip that I have only has 4 leds but this verilog could be changed to accommodate fewer/greater leds.

I will be using the BASYS 3 FPGA prototyping board from Xilinx for this project.
