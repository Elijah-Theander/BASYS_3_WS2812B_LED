# WSB_LED
This is a project from my Advanced Digital Design class that I am turning into a personal project because I enjoyed playing around with these LED strips


This project is requiring a lot of timing calculations and head scratching.
I'm hoping that my comments in the modules themselves are solid enough to make out what's going on. 
This is a series of Finite state machines dedicated to driving a strip of four GRB leds in various modes.
The strip that I have only has 4 leds but this code could be changed to accommadate fewer/greater leds.
